## Tips for Winning More in Monopoly Go

While free dice are a great start, becoming a **Monopoly Go** champion requires more than just extra rolls. Here are some strategies to help you win:

- **Buy Properties Early**: The earlier you buy properties, the sooner you can start collecting rent. Look for deals on properties that can help you build valuable sets.
- **Upgrade Your Properties**: Once you own a set, upgrade the properties with houses or hotels. This increases your rent collection and makes it harder for opponents to afford your properties.
- **Negotiate Deals**: Monopoly is all about making deals. Use your extra dice to roll through the game and gather assets that can be used for future trades with other players.
- **Save Money for the Future**: Itâ€™s easy to spend all your money, but make sure to save some for critical moments, like when you land on another playerâ€™s hotel or need to pay rent.
